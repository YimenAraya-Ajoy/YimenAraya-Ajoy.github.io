## üåç Understanding Adaptation in a Changing World  

Habitats are disappearing, ecosystems are fragmenting, and climate change is accelerating at an unprecedented rate. Predicting how populations will respond to these environmental shifts is one of the most pressing challenges in biology. Addressing this challenge requires a deep understanding of the **demographic consequences of gene-environment interactions** and the role of **behavioral plasticity** in shaping adaptive responses.  

## üß¨ Bridging Ecology and Evolution  

Evolutionary biology has developed powerful theoretical and quantitative tools to study adaptation. However, a lack of integration across ecological and evolutionary disciplines limits our ability to understand how **phenotypic evolution influences population dynamics**. My research aims to bridge this gap by integrating **behavioral ecology, quantitative genetics, and evolutionary demography**, leveraging their complementary perspectives on adaptation.

By synthesizing:  

- **Optimality theory** from behavioral ecology,  
- **Quantitative genetic models** of evolutionary responses to selection, and  
- **Projection techniques** from evolutionary demography,  

I seek to advance our understanding of **eco-evolutionary dynamics in a rapidly changing world**.
