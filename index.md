# **M**ultilevel **A**nimal **E**volutionary **E**cology Lab

Phenotypic variation is structured hierarchically, from individuals to entire communities. Our lab explores how interactions within and across these levels drive the evolution of biological diversity and determine the long term persistence of ecosystems.

Phenotypic variation occurs at multiple levels:  
- Within individuals (e.g., behavioral plasticity)  
- Among individuals within populations (genes and developmental plasticty)   
- Among populations within species (local adaptation and drift)  
- Among species within communities (speciation and hybridization)  
- Among communities (e.g., temperate versus tropical)  



## Towards a More Integrative Evolutionary Ecology

Traditionally, different scientific fields have focused on understanding the causes and consequences of variation at specific levels.  To embrace the multi-level nature of biological organization, our research integrates behavioral ecology, quantitative genetics, and population ecology.

By embedding detailed empirical studies within these theoretical frameworks, we aim to understand how gene-environment interactions and behavioral plasticity shape phenotypic expression, selection, and population growth. 

Our research integrates empirical, methodological, and theoretical advancements in evolutionary ecology. Grounded in robust theoretical frameworks our work combines analytical theory, individual-based and statistical simulations, with detailed analyses of long-term individual-based data using flexible programming languages like R and Stan.

Together, these approaches allow us to explore eco-evolutionary dynamics in a rapidly changing world.
