**Understanding Adaptation in a Changing World**

Habitats are disappearing, ecosystems are fragmenting, and climate change is accelerating at an unprecedented rate. Predicting how populations will respond to these environmental shifts is one of the most pressing challenges in biology. Addressing this challenge requires a deep understanding of the demographic consequences of gene-environment interactions and the role of behavioral plasticity in shaping adaptive responses. 

Our research focuses on developing general frameworks that are adaptable to specific study systems, ensuring broad theoretical insights have practical applications. We am committed to open science, prioritizing transparency, inclusivity, and equitable access to resources. To support this, We preferentially publish in society-run journals that reinvest
profits into the scientific community and rely on open-source software to enhance reproducibility and accessibility. Through international collaborations, innovative methodologies, and knowledge-sharing initiatives, We aim to advance fundamental research while ensuring its broad applicability and impact.

Our research integrates empirical, methodological, and theoretical advancements in evolutionary ecology. Grounded in robust theoretical frameworks our work combines analytical theory, individual-based and statistical simulations, with detailed analyses of long-term individual-based data using flexible programming languages like R and Stan.

**Towards a more Integrative Evolutionary Ecology**

Evolutionary biology has developed powerful theoretical and quantitative tools to study adaptation. However, a lack of integration with ecological disciplines limits our ability to understand how **phenotypic evolution influences population dynamics. Our research aims to bridge this gap by integrating behavioral ecology, quantitative genetics, and evolutionary demography, leveraging their complementary perspectives on adaptation.

By synthesizing:  

- **Optimality theory** from behavioral ecology,  
- **Evolutionary predictions** of the responses to selection from quantitative genetic and 
- **Projection techniques** from evolutionary demography,  

We seek to advance our understanding of **eco-evolutionary dynamics in a rapidly changing world**.
