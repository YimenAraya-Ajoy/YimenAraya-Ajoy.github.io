Habitats are increasingly being lost and fragmented, and the climate is changing at unprecedented rates. Predicting population responses to these environmental changes is one of the most pressing challenges in biology. Addressing this challenge requires a deep understanding of the demographic consequences of gene-environment interactions and how these are modulated by behavioral plasticity. 

\hspace*{0.5cm} Evolutionary biology has developed powerful theoretical and quantitative tools to study adaptation, yet a lack of integration across ecological and evolutionary disciplines limits our understanding of how phenotypic evolution affects population dynamics. My research aims to bridge this gap by integrating behavioral ecology, quantitative genetics, and evolutionary demography exploiting their complementary perspectives on adaptation. By synthesizing optimality theory from behavioral ecology, quantitative genetic models of evolutionary responses to selection, and projection techniques from evolutionary demography, I am uniquely positioned to advance our understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics in changing environments.
