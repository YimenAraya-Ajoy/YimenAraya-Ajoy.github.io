## Socio-Eco-Evo Dynamics

One of our main lines of research focuses on the ecological and evolutionary consequences of social interactions. We view the social environment as a key driver of eco-evolutionary dynamics. With social environments we mean the number and phenotypic composition with whom and individual interacts. These social environment affects phenotypic expression, selection and population dynamics.

## Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics of Small Fragmented Populations

We are also lucky to be working on unique studying system focusing on a metapopulation of house sparrows encompaissng 11 islands that have been monitored since 1998. Here we have been helping to unravel the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of birds living in small fragemented populations.
