We aim to foster a creative and inclusive research and teaching
environment by being open-minded and approachable in order to create a
space where diverse perspectives are valued and innovative ideas
flourish. We try to be understanding of the challenges of research and
learning in the hopes of offering guidance through clear communication
and mentorship. We are strongly committed to inclusivity and diversity,
and prioritize the well-being of students.
